RoboScore is a customizable score calculator for robotics competitions like FLL. What differentiates RoboScore from other scoring apps is that you can define your own calculator with the task ordered like you solve them, or mission descriptions you actually understand. You can even create a calculator for off-season challenges you came up with on your own!
